Traverse through Bran Castle, dodging bats and spiders,
and take down the evil vampire Dracula!

Find the ladders in each level to go to the next stage
until you find Dracula.

WASD to move.

IJKL to throw stakes.

You can kill enemies by running into them, but you'll
also get hurt.

Use stakes to kill things without hurting yourself.

Remember, you only have 9. Use them wisely!
